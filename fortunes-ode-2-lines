We are the music makers,
And we are the dreamers of dreams,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,
And sitting by desolate streams; -
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
World-losers and world-forsakers,
On whom the pale moon gleams:
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Yet we are the movers and shakers
Of the world for ever, it seems.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
With wonderful deathless ditties
We build up the world's great cities,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And out of a fabulous story
We fashion an empire's glory:
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
One man with a dream, at pleasure,
Shall go forth and conquer a crown;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And three with a new song's measure
Can trample a kingdom down.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
We, in the ages lying
In the buried past of the earth,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Built Nineveh with our sighing,
And Babel itself in our mirth;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And o'erthrew them with prophesying
To the old of the new world's worth;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
For each age is a dream that is dying,
Or one that is coming to birth.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
A breath of our inspiration
Is the life of each generation;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
A wondrous thing of our dreaming
Unearthly, impossible seeming -
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
The soldier, the king, and the peasant
Are working together in one,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Till our dream shall become their present,
And their work in the world be done.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
They had no vision amazing
Of the goodly house they are raising;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
They had no divine foreshowing
Of the land to which they are going:
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
But on one man's soul it hath broken,
A light that doth not depart;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And his look, or a word he hath spoken,
Wrought flame in another man's heart.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And therefore to-day is thrilling
With a past day's late fulfilling;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And the multitudes are enlisted
In the faith that their fathers resisted,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And, scorning the dream of to-morrow,
Are bringing to pass, as they may,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
In the world, for its joy or its sorrow,
The dream that was scorned yesterday.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
But we, with our dreaming and singing,
Ceaseless and sorrowless we!
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
The glory about us clinging
Of the glorious futures we see,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Our souls with high music ringing:
O men! it must ever be
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
That we dwell, in our dreaming and singing,
A little apart from ye.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
For we are afar with the dawning
And the suns that are not yet high,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And out of the infinite morning
Intrepid you hear us cry -
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
How, spite of your human scorning,
Once more God's future draws nigh,
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
And already goes forth the warning
That ye of the past must die.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Great hail! we cry to the comers
From the dazzling unknown shore;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Bring us hither your sun and your summers;
And renew our world as of yore;
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
You shall teach us your song's new numbers,
And things that we dreamed not before:
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
%
Yea, in spite of a dreamer who slumbers,
And a singer who sings no more.
  -- Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy
